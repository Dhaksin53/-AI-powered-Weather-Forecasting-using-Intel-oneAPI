# AI-powered Weather Forecasting using Intel oneAPI

## Overview
This project focuses on creating an AI model for weather forecasting using historical weather data. The model will be built and optimized using Intel oneAPI's powerful libraries, such as oneMKL for data analysis and oneDNN for deep learning model training.

Prerequisites
Intel oneAPI Toolkit
Python 3.8 or above
Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
Necessary Python libraries (see requirements.txt)
Installation
Set up Intel oneAPI: Ensure you have the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit installed on your system. You can download it from Intel's official website.

Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
You can use any publicly available weather dataset that includes features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. A good example is the NOAA Global Surface Summary of the Day dataset.

Place your dataset in the data/raw/ directory.

Data Preprocessing
To start with, the raw weather data needs to be preprocessed:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, correct anomalies, and format the data correctly.
Feature Engineering: Create new features like moving averages, temperature differences, etc., that could help the model.
Normalization: Normalize the data for better performance during model training.
Run the preprocessing script:


python src/preprocessing.py
This will generate the processed dataset in the data/processed/ directory.

Model Development
Model Architecture
We will use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is well-suited for time-series forecasting.

Training
The model training script (src/model.py) uses Intel oneDNN to accelerate the training process.

Load the processed data.
Split the data into training and validation sets.
Define the RNN/LSTM model architecture using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, with oneDNN acceleration.
Train the model and save the trained model in the results/ directory.
Run the training script:


python src/model.py
Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The evaluation results will be saved in the results/ directory.

Inference
After training, you can use the model to make weather predictions:

Load the trained model.
Provide new input data for prediction.
The script will output the forecasted weather conditions.
Run the inference script:

python src/inference.py
Results
The results of the model, including predictions and evaluation metrics, will be stored in the results/ directory. You can visualize these results using tools like Matplotlib or Plotly.

Optimization with Intel oneAPI
To further optimize the model:

Use Intel oneMKL: Accelerate matrix operations within the model to improve training time.
Quantization: Use Intel’s quantization tools to reduce the model size and inference time without significant loss in accuracy.
Parallelization: Leverage Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) to parallelize parts of the code for faster processing.
Future Enhancements
Real-time Data: Integrate real-time weather data to make live predictions.
Model Tuning: Experiment with different architectures (like GRU) and hyperparameters for better accuracy.
Visualization: Add a web interface to visualize the predictions and historical data trends.
